# Complete the 'bomberMan' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return a STRING_ARRAY.
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. INTEGER n
#  2. STRING_ARRAY grid
# 

# Bomberman lives in a rectangular grid. Each cell in the grid either contains a bomb or nothing at all.
# Each bomb can be planted in any cell of the grid but, once planted, it will detonate after exactly 3 seconds.
# Once a bomb detonates, it's destroyed â€” along with anything in its four neighboring cells.
# This means that if a bomb detonates in cell i, j, any valid cells (i +- 1, j) and (i, j +- 1) are cleared.
# Bomberman is immune to bombs, so he can move freely throughout the grid.
# Here's what he does:
# 1. Initially, Bomberman arbitrarily plants bombs in some of the cells, the initial state.
# 2. After one second, Bomberman does nothing.
# 3. After one more second, Bomberman plants bombs in all cells without bombs, thus filling the whole grid with bombs. No bombs detonate at this point.
# 4. After one more second, any bombs planted exactly three seconds ago will detonate. Here, Bomberman stands back and observes.
# 5. Bomberman then repeats steps 3 and 4 indefinitely.

# Note: Bomberman can move any number of cells in a single move, but he can't move diagonally. He stops moving once he's adjacent to a wall and can't move into the wall.
# Given the initial configuration of the grid with the locations of Bomberman's first batch of planted bombs, determine the state of the grid after n seconds.
