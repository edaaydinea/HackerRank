    "# Day 26: Nested Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "*Author: Eda AYDIN*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Todayâ€™s challenge puts your understanding of nested conditional statements to the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: $fine = 0$.\n",
    "2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, $fine = 15 Hackos x (the number of days late)$.\n",
    "3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the $fine = 500 Hackos x (the number of months late)$.\n",
    "4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of $10000 Hackos$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "$d1, m1, y1 = 12312014$  returned date\n",
    "$d2, m2, y2 = 112015$ due date\n",
    "\n",
    "The book is returned on time, so no fine is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "$d1, m1, y1 = 112015$ returned date\n",
    "$d2, m2, y2 = 12312014$ due date\n",
    "\n",
    "The book is returned in the following year, so the fine is a fixed 10000.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Format\n",
    "The first line contains $3$ space-separated integers denoting the respective $day$, $month$, and $year$ on which the book was actually returned.\n",
    "The second line contains $3$ space-separated integers denoting the respective $day$, $month$, and $year$ on which the book was expected to be returned (due date).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- &1 <= D <= 31&\n",
    "- &1 <= M <= 12&\n",
    "- &1 <= Y <= 3000&\n",
    "- &It is guaranteed that the dates will be valid Gregorian calendar dates.&\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Format\n",
    "Print a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Input\n",
    "\n",
