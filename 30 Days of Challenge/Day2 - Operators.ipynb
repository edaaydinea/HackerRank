    "# Day 2: Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "*Author: Eda AYDIN*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ meal_{cost}= 100 \\\\\n",
    "           tip_{percent} = 15 \\\\\n",
    "           tax_{percent} = 8 $\n",
    "\n",
    "A tip pf 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 6. Print $123$ and return from the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the solve function in the editor below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve has the following parameters:\n",
    "- int meal_cost = the cost of food before tip and tax\n",
    "- int tip_percent: the tip percentage\n",
    "- int tax_percent: the tax percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 lines of numeric input.\n",
    "The first line has a double, $meal_{cost}$ (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).\n",
    "The second line has an integer, $tip_{percent}$ (the percentage of $mealCost$ being added as tip).\n",
    "The third line has an integer, $tax_{percent}$ (the percentage of $mealCost$ being added as tax).\n",
    "\n",
    "##Sample Input\n",
    "\n",
    "        12.00\n",
    "        20\n",
    "        8\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Output\n",
    "\n",
    "        15\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "$$ meal_{cost} = 12\\,, tip_{percent} = 20\\,, tax_{percent} = 8 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculations:\n",
    "$$ tip = 12\\,\\,and\\,\\frac{12}{100} \\times 20 = 2.4 \\\\\n",
    "   tax = 8\\,\\,and\\,\\frac{8}{100} \\times 20 = 0.96 \\\\\n",
    "   total_{cost} = meal_{cost}\\, +\\, tip\\, +\\, tax\\, = 12 + 2.4 + 0.96 = 15.36 \\\\\n",
    "   round(total_{cost}) = 15 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We round $total_{cost}$ to the nearest integer and print the result $15$."
